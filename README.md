# Phenomenon-Description, Detection & Prediction

## Introduction

In this repository you will find the codes related to my research on the description, detection and prediction of the spread of emerging phenomena in the world.

## Project Structure

## Methodology

## Installation

For now the code is only tested and maintained for `Linux operating systems`, so I advise you to use Docker if you work on any other operating system.

### Virtual environment

Setting up the virtual environment:

- Change directory to the project root directory: `phenomenon-ddp/`
- Run `python -m venv ievenv`. (python needs to be installed)
- Run virtual environment:
   - On Linux: `source {path/to/the/project/}venv/bin/activate`
- Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Update requirements.txt: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
