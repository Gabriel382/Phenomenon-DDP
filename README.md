# Text Corpus Exploration and Ontology Generation

Welcome to the Text Corpus Exploration and Ontology Generation repository! This project utilizes [GATE NLP](https://github.com/GateNLP/gate-core) to create a corpus from text sources, explores the corpus using NLP techniques and Ontology Learning, and generates a domain ontology.

## Summary

The Text Corpus Exploration and Ontology Generation project aims to process large text sources and extract valuable insights through NLP and Ontology Learning techniques. By leveraging GATE NLP and a combination of Java and Python, this project allows for the creation of a corpus, exploration of the data, extraction of terms and concepts, and the generation of a domain ontology.

## Installation

To use the Text Corpus Exploration and Ontology Generation project, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-corpus-ontology-generation.git`
2. Install GATE NLP: Follow the instructions provided in the [GATE NLP repository](https://github.com/GateNLP/gate-core) to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Set up the Java environment: Ensure that Java is properly installed and configured.
4. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation, you can utilize the Text Corpus Exploration and Ontology Generation project as follows:

1. Use Java and GATE NLP to create a corpus collection from your text sources.
2. Apply NLP techniques, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, to explore the corpus and extract relevant information.
3. Utilize Ontology Learning techniques to identify terms, synonyms, concepts, and hierarchical relationships within the corpus.
4. Use Python scripts to process the extracted data and generate a domain ontology.
5. In a subsequent phase (not implemented in this project), align the generated domain ontology with the core ontology from the [GATE NLP repository](https://github.com/GateNLP/gate-core).

## Example Experiments

To showcase the capabilities of the Text Corpus Exploration and Ontology Generation project, we conducted experiments using the Aylien dataset (https://aylien.com/resources/datasets/coronavirus-dataset) to create an ontology for COVID-19. Here are the key findings:

- The project successfully detected COVID-19 as a virus and captured its attributes and related concepts.
- However, some challenges were encountered in accurately classifying certain concepts within the ontology hierarchy. Further improvements and refinements are required in this area.
